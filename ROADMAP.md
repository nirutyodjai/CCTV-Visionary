# Roadmap for CCTV Visionary

This document outlines the strategic development plan to evolve "CCTV Visionary" from an advanced planning tool into an indispensable, end-to-end security system lifecycle management platform.

## Guiding Principle
Our vision is to transcend being a mere "Planning Tool." We aim to create a "Platform for End-to-End Security System Lifecycle Management," making CCTV Visionary a globally recognized, industry-standard tool.

## Phase 1: Hyper-Intelligent AI

This phase focuses on deepening the AI's capabilities, moving from analysis to creative generation and predictive insights.

| Feature                               | Description                                                                                             | Why it's Cutting-Edge                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Generative Floor Plan from Sketch** | AI generates a clean, vectorized digital floor plan from a user's rough sketch or an old photograph.      | Drastically lowers the barrier to entry for users, enabling immediate planning.           |
| **Automated Cable Pathfinding**       | AI automatically calculates and draws the most optimal cable routes (UTP & Fiber), avoiding obstacles.    | Saves significant planning time and provides highly accurate cable length estimations for BOM. |
| **Predictive Security Analysis**      | AI analyzes the plan for security vulnerabilities (e.g., blind spots near critical areas, sun glare). | Shifts analysis from purely physical to behavioral and risk-based assessment.             |

## Phase 2: Simulation & Validation

This phase is about creating a "Digital Twin" of the security system, allowing for thorough testing and validation before any physical installation occurs.

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                | Why it's Cutting-Edge                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive 3D Walkthrough**    | Generate a 3D model from the 2D plan, allowing users to "walk" through the space and see from each camera's POV. | Offers an immersive, realistic experience that vastly improves camera placement decisions.      |
| **Environmental Simulation**      | Simulate various conditions like nighttime, rain, or fog to test camera performance (especially IR).         | Validates camera specifications against real-world conditions, preventing costly mistakes.    |
| **Network Load Simulation**       | Calculate the total network bandwidth to identify potential bottlenecks in switches and NVRs during design.    | Prevents under-speccing of network hardware and ensures system stability.                     |

## Phase 3: Real-World Integration & Automation

This phase bridges the gap between the digital plan and the physical world, making the platform an active participant in installation and maintenance.

| Feature                                 | Description                                                                                                  | Why it's Cutting-Edge                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Augmented Reality (AR) Install Guide**| A mobile app feature that overlays device locations and cable paths onto the real-world view via a camera.   | A game-changer for installation technicians, dramatically reducing errors and setup time.   |
| **Automated Device Config Scripts**     | Export configuration files for network devices (switches, etc.) with all VLANs and IP settings pre-configured. | Reduces error-prone manual configuration and seamlessly links design to deployment.        |
| **Live System Monitoring (IoT)**        | Connect the platform to the installed system to act as a live dashboard for device status and alerts.      | Transforms the app from a one-time tool into a long-term maintenance and operations platform. |
